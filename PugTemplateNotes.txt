l1. if you want to declare any tag just write directly h1 and if you want to write and text between tag add space 
   and then write text at the end we write in pug template will converted to html and in pug template 
   you do not have to end any tag 

ex. html >> <h1>Hello</h1>
    pug >> h1 hello


2. if you want to add any element as child then use indentation

ex. html >> <div>
              <h1>Hello</h1>
            </div>

    pug >> div
             h1 hello

3. if you want to add any attribute inside any html tag

ex. 
html>> <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"></link>

pug>>  link(rel='stylesheet' href='css/style.css')


4. you can also access value from response then 
 -1st way h1= tour
 -2nd way h1 #{tour}

5. write javascript inside pug template directly

pug>> - const x=9;
      h2= 2 * x  

6.if you want to add element with class & attribute & Text

ex. 
html >> <h1 class="header-title" bold="true">hello</h1>
pug  >> h1.header-title(bold='true') hello

7. If you want to separate all diffrent section to diffrent file
and then you wnat to merge this into single file you can also do this.

create diffrent file then write code for example we have header design
that we first write into "_header.pug" and then I need to use this inside 
"base.pug" so where i have to display this code header code 
there i just have to write "include _header"
